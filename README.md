# Finial_Project

1) I want to create a website that allows Java to rearrange the html elements for different formats. A kind of manual responsive site. 

2) I want to create an interactive HTML site using Java script that could change the typefaces styles or color.

3) I want to create a html that has java elements that help communicate a look and feel of a brand.
