# Game maze design

A maze that is different everytime you play and your objective is to reach the center.

## Summary

This project was difficult for me to do on my own. At first I wanted to do a game that allowed the player to jump up and down. I learned that it was really difficult to code gravity. I searched online for references but they were accessing Javascript and not the P5 libarary. Because of this I got stuck trying to figure it out and had a late start on the project. I quickly changed my design to something I had a better idea of. I wanted to create a maze using rectangles because I understand how the shape works better and thought it would be easier to draw the objects.

I wanted the player to be able to move an object around the maze and if the player touches the edges, then the game resets and he is sent back to the start and generates a new map of rectangles as objects. If the player touches the win object then the player wins and ends the game. 

## Component Parts

Rectangles
Player Peice
Win Object

Inputs - up, down,left and right
Data - Rectangles - Objects - Win object - Define edges

## When your project is completed, you will then add the following sections:

## Timeline

What did you do in each of the past four weeks?

- Week 0: Write Proposal - Game Jumping platformer
- Week 1: Research how to code gravity
- Week 2: Attempting to Code Gravity / More Research / Switched to Maze Design - coded starting structure
- Week 3: Begin Coding with Tutor Maze Design
- Week 4: Present!

## Challenges

Coding gravity was really difficult. I could not find sources online that was in P5 but only in javascript because of this I was following tutorials that would not work for my project and kept running into walls. 

When i started doing the maze project, i had a difficult time understanding how to make functions so i needed help with my coding. I had recieved help from a tutor three times to help me figure out my code. I had another hard time scripting the win square so that it would not draw if it overlaps with obsticles. I had it drawed seperately outside the loop but had a hard time thining about how to do it within the loop after the fact I would generate the map.
